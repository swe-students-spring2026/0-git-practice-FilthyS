[Fighting the Last War: The Fall of Singapore and the Shift to AI-Native Software Development](https://heemeng.medium.com/fighting-the-last-war-the-fall-of-singapore-and-the-shift-to-ai-native-software-development-289fabb90535)


At the same time, the limits appeared just as clearly. AI-generated code exposed hard-coded secrets, missed edge cases, and struggled when real-world environments diverged from documentation. Architectural decisions, test strategy, security, and debugging non-obvious failures *required human judgment at every stage*.

The most important insight wasn’t whether AI could build an entire CI/CD pipeline autonomously — it can’t, not yet. It was that **the bottleneck had moved**. Writing code and tests became cheap. Deciding *what should exist*, *what mattered*, and *what could fail* became the scarce skill.

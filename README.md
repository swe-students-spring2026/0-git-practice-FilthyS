## Insights

> If we assumed that AI will generate 70–80% of our code within two years, what would we stop doing today?

The article how modern software development/organization practices face the challenges and risk of being outdated facing the current of AI-driven development. AI is not just a tool that augment workflows in the software development industy - ***it changes the nature of software delivery, and how development teams are organized***. The organizations that thrive will be those that *recognize this shift early*, *update their doctrines*, and *reorganize around AI-native practices* rather than cling to outdated assumptions.

## Comments

*(Albert Chen azc9673)* While I certainly understand and partially agree with many software engineers' job security fears surrounding AI-driven software development, I believe it is most important given the circumstances for SWEs to focus on learning how to integrate AI tools and technologies into their workflows to maximize their efficiency working with AI. As it stands, all AI coding tools still require a competent developer to actually properly utilize while building real life applications.
